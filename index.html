        <div class="firstArticle">Skiing nordic
            <p> Nordic skiing encompasses the various types of skiing in which the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the
                binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike alpine skiing, where the boot is
                attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark
                skiing.

        <div class="secondArticle">Skiing
            <p> Skiing is the use of skis to glide on snow. Variations of purpose include basic transport, a
                recreational activity, or a competitive winter sport. Many types of competitive skiing events are
                recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).

        <div class="thirdArticle">Snowboarding
            <p> Snowboarding is a recreational and competitive activity that involves descending a snow-covered surface
                while standing on a snowboard that is almost always attached to a rider's feet. It features in the
                Winter Olympic Games and Winter Paralympic Games.

        <div class="fourthArticle"> Ice
            <p> Ice skating is the self-propulsion and gliding of a person across an ice surface, using metal-bladed ice
                skates. People skate for various reasons, including recreation (fun), exercise, competitive sports, and
                commuting. Ice skating may be performed on naturally frozen bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes,
                canals, and rivers, and on human-made ice surfaces both indoors and outdoors.
